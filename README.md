# Motivation
My wife runs a small family veterinary practice in a beautiful town of Mill Valley, California called **[Camino ALto Veterinary Hospital](https://caminoaltovet.com/)**. 
Six 6 years ago when she acquired the practice, I helped her build the website along with some of the cool features which are completely unique to her website like "Ask your doctor". 
Many a times in the night/ weekend she has gotten a message through it and has replied to provide quality care for her pet family. Making "Online" appintments is very easy and intuitive and she get many requests per day.

The site was completly built serverless & responsive in 2013 and has been running with very little maintenance.
