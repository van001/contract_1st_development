# Motivation
My wife runs a small family veterinary practice in a beautiful town of Mill Valley, California called **[Camino ALto Veterinary Hospital](https://caminoaltovet.com/)**. 
Six 6 years ago when she acquired the practice, I helped her build the website along with some of the cool features which are completely unique to her website like "Ask your doctor". 
Many a times in the night/ weekend she has gotten a message through it and has replied to provide quality care for her pet family. Making "Online" appintments is very easy and intuitive and she get many requests per day.

The website, built in 2013, is completely serverless & 100% responsive. It has been since running with very little maintenance and zero downtime. 

And then Covid19 happened and world suddenly got virtual, she felt why not make the wbesite more dynamic and modern for the next generation.

This project is series of projects that I will be building before I build the next geneation website for her.
