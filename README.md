# Motivation
My wife runs a small family veterinary practice in a beautiful town of Mill Valley, California called **[Camino ALto Veterinary Hospital](https://caminoaltovet.com/)**. 
Six 6 years ago when she acquired the practice, I helped her build the website along with some of the cool features which are completely unique to her website like "Ask your doctor". It was completly built serverless in 2013 and has been running with very little maintenance.
