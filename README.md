# Motivation
My wife runs a small family veterinary practice in a beautiful town of Mill Valley, California called **[Camino ALto Veterinary Hospital](https://caminoaltovet.com/)**. 
Six 6 years ago when she acquired the practice, I helped her build the website along with some of the cool features which are completely unique to her website like "Ask your doctor". 
Many a times in the night/ weekend she has gotten a message through it and has replied to provide quality care for her pet family. 
Making "Online" appointments is very easy and intuitive and she get many requests every day.

And then Covid19 happened and world suddenly got more virtual, she felt the need for more dynamic, personal and next generation website.

This project is one of the series of projects that I will be building before I build the next generation website for her.

# Philosophy
Since I am a big fan of automation, I am going to pick tools/ technologies and build architecture & frameworks to help me 
automate the build, deployment and testing process while keeping the cost as low as possible.
